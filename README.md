# Oblique Decision Trees
Project for the Fall 2018 section of CS-484-001 at George Mason University

Explores the performance of two newly created decision tree methods and compares their performance on eight datasets against to two existing stock decision tree methods

### Prerequisites
* Java SE Development Kit (JDK) 8+
* Python 3.6+
* GCC 4.8+
* numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
* scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org)
* scipy (https://www.scipy.org/)

### Getting Started
To run all of the decision tree methods on the provided datasets run main.py.

### Stock Methods:
* CART (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
* OC1 (https://genomics10.bu.edu/yangsu/rankgene/oc1.html)
  - Note: minor modifications were made to the original source code
